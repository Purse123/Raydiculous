## Variable:
```java
int суки = 0;
```
1. **Instance variables (Non-static Fields):**
   - It belongs to an object.
   - Each instance has its own unique value for that var.
2. **Class variables (Static Fields):**
   - Variable declared with `static` keyword
   - Shared by all instances of class *only one copy exists*
3. **Local variables**
4. **Parameters**

- **Primitive Data Type:**
  - byte(8-bit), short(16-bit), int(32-bit), long(64-bit), float(32-bit IEEE 754), double (64-bit IEEE 754), boolean, char(16-bit unicode *min '\u0000' max '\uffff'*).

- **String literals:** 
  - \b (backspace), \t (tab), \n (line feed), \f (form feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote), \' (single quote), and \\ (backslash).

- **Underscore in num literal**
- In Java (since Java 7), you can use underscore characters (_) inside numeric literals to make them more readable.
- Similar to how we write numbers with commas or spaces in real life.
- we can't use **at beginning or end**, **adjacent to decimal point**, **prior to F or L sufix** and **position where string is expected**.
